iQue Dumper 
===========

This is a rough tool I threw together back in 2012 when I initially
reverse engineered the iQue USB protocol. It can dump blocks from NAND
and flash LEDs. For an overview of the USB protocol, see [the USB
protocol notes](usb_protocol.md).

    Usage: ./ique_dumper <filename> <block1> [ <block2> ... ]
